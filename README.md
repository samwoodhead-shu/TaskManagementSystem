Task Management System - Software Project Assigment
 
Objectives:

To develop a dedicated task management app that allows users to
Create personal profiles,
Log in to their accounts securely with a proper authentication process,
Add multiple tasks within the app,
Manage multiple task lists, and
Mark tasks as completed.


Project Overview:

The task app needs to have an intuitive interface that will make it easier for users to interact with the app and manage their tasks.
The task app must allow users to create distinct accounts and start managing their everyday tasks effectively. A user's data should only be accessible to him/her, and an authentication system needs to be in place to safeguard the account from unauthorized access or accidental login.
As for the app, the user should add individual tasks or organize multiple tasks under a single task list. Also, the user should have the flexibility to create multiple tasks lists and manage several tasks altogether. Once completed, users can mark a task as completed.
